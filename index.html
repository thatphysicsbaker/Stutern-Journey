            <h1>Experience so far</h1>
            <p><i>I applied for the course <b>Mobile development,</b> without having any prior knowledge on programming/software development. At the beginning of the course which was the personal study nd group sessions,I was kind of confused but when we started our classes with tutors,i began to understand and flow.<br>Our first tutor really did justice to <b>git and html</b> and i'm glad i'm with this programme.<br><b>CSS</b> hasn't been bad but its kind of complicated as I am getting familiair with the selectors and other attributes.<br> I got to understand that <b>CSS</b> adds beauty to the structure created by <b>html</b> and helps the viewer relate to whatever is displayed.</i></p>
